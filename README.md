## 本书概述

Explore the origins of C++ myths and their relevance today, learn to sidestep common pitfalls, and adopt modern best practices to master the evolving C++ programming landscape

**关于本书**

Think you know C++? Think again.

For decades, C++ has been clouded by myths and misunderstandings—from its early design decisions to misconceptions that still linger today. Claims like "C++ is too hard to learn" or "C++ is obsolete" are often rooted in some truth, but they are outdated and fail to capture the language’s ongoing evolution and modern capabilities.

Written by industry veterans with over 40 years of combined experience, this book uncovers the myths, exploring their origins and relevance in the context of today’s C++ landscape. It equips you with a deeper understanding of advanced features and best practices to elevate your projects. Each chapter tackles a specific misconception, shedding light on C++'s modern features, such as smart pointers, lambdas, and concurrency. You’ll learn practical strategies to navigate common challenges like code portability and compiler compatibility, as well as how to incorporate modern best practices into your C++ codebase to optimize performance and future-proof your projects.

By the end of this book, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of C++'s evolution, equipping you to make informed decisions and harness its powerful features to enhance your skills, coding practices, and projects.

**主要特点**

* Trace the origins of C++ misconceptions and understand why they persist
* Learn to avoid pitfalls caused by misunderstood C++ standards
* Leverage the lesser-known features of the C++ programming language
* Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook

**内容包括**

* Comprehend the history of C++ and the design decisions that shape modern challenges
* Master program flow and its underlying principles to resolve issues effectively
* Tackle incompatibility across compilers and platforms with ease
* Identify issues and avoid writing code that may lead to undefined behavior
* Explore advanced C++ features not typically covered in academia
* Address concerns about compiler code generation and optimizations
* Understand why undefined behavior remains intentionally undefined

**适读人群**

This book is for intermediate-to-advanced C++ developers looking to deepen their understanding of the language’s complexities. It is perfect for coders eager to avoid common mistakes, hackers, scholars with a sense of humor, or anyone with an interest in C++. Programmers who want to expand their knowledge, refine existing skills, explore new paradigms, or dive into the nuances of C++, will find valuable insights. Technical leads and software engineering managers adopting new technologies or navigating the C++ ecosystem will also benefit from this book.


## 作者简介

[Alex Bolboaca](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B07VGJ5RND/about?ingress=0&visitId=3681fba3-55d3-4740-bd35-8040d21f011d&ref_=ap_rdr) was born in the mythical lands of Transylvania, Romania, in 1977, the year when Star Wars launched. He read the first book on computers when he was 10, and found the topic fascinating, which pushed him towards the new domain of software development. Fortunately, the main obstacle towards his desired career was pushed away with the Romanian Revolution from 1989, leaving Alex free to pursue his interests.

[Ferenc Deák](https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0DT724DDC/about?ingress=0&visitId=1d5aad24-db29-468e-aa25-2626037f0f87&ref_=ap_rdr) is a software developer with over 15 years of experience specializing in system programming, software security, and application design. Based in Trondheim, Norway, he has worked on projects involving autonomous systems, real-time traffic solutions, and cryptographic applications.
